# Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning
_Built from scratch with PyTorch_

## Description

This repository is an exercise project to implement the algorithms described in the book [Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Practice in Python](https://slm-lab.gitbook.io/slm-lab/publications-and-talks/instruction-for-the-book-+-intro-to-rl-section) by _Graesser, L., & Keng, W. L_. The main goal is to try to replicate the results and get plots as similar as those in the book. The constraint and challenge is that I will restrict myself to look only to the theory section and not the implementation given by the authors. In case I need more details about what could be going wrong, I will check the original paper and its implementation.
